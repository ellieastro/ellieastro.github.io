        <p>My PhD research primarily focuses on the observational analysis of the multiple stellar populations present within my selected sample of 30 Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs). To gain a wide-field view of each GC, I employed a two-fold approach. Firstly, I used Hubble Space Telescope photometry to target the central regions of the cluster. Secondly, I used ground-based photometry from the extensive catalogue provided by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09925"> Stetson et al. (2019)</a> to observe the outer regions. Using both sets of photometric data, I separated the stars into their respective multiple populations and determined their spatial distributions within the cluster. <br><br>This investigation sought to determine whether any of the stellar populations exhibited central concentration. The homogeneous analysis of this large sample of diverse GCs revealed a wide range of spatial distributions, further advancing our understanding of the possible formation scenarios of GCs and the mysterious multiple stellar populations they contain. For more information on this section of my PhD project, see my recent <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04166">paper</a>. <br><br><br></p>

    <h2>-  Scientific Outreach and Teaching  -</h2>
    <div class="text-content">
        <p> Throughout my degree, I've participated in outreach events as a science demonstrator for the <a href="https://www.uq.edu.au/news/video/demo-troupe-tours-regional-schools"> Demo Troupe</a> at the University of Queensland, which demonstrates fascinating physics such as Tesla Coils and Superconductors in the format of a live show. I have also assisted in organising and tutoring for the <a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/junior-physics-odyssey"> Junior Physics Odyssey</a> at the University of Queensland - a program which encourages High School students to pursue an interest in physics by demonstrating popular physics experiments and providing support and feedback on their problem-solving skills. The same concept was also applied in the <a href="https://smp.uq.edu.au/article/2023/07/astrophysics-work-experience-program-2023"> Astrophysics work experience program</a> at the university, for which I supervised 8 High School students.<br><br>During my undergraduate degree I have also spent 5 years as a tutor employed by the University of Queensland to lead tutorials, workshops and laboratory experiments in the topics of Electromagnetism and Modern Physics, Theory and Practice in Science, the Physical Basis of Biological Systems and Numerical Methods in Computational Science. During tutorials and workshops, tutors are expected to give short lectures and assist undergraduate students in problem solving. Laboratory tutors carry out these same duties, as well as demonstrations and supervision of a range of physics experiments. Tutors are also employed by the university as grading assistants, providing the marks and feedback on assignments and laboratory reports. Additionally, I spent 2 years employed by the university as a Physics Laboratory Assistant, which also required me to assemble a wide range of experiments for first, second and third year physics courses, with each course requiring 3-5 different experiments per semester. <br><br><br></p>
